# scCircle-seq analysis

1. General pipeline for scCircle-seq:
    (1) Mapping 
    (2) QC with linear and circular spike-in reads ratio
    (3) Calling circle region for single cell
    (4) Reconstruct the circle with AA(https://github.com/virajbdeshpande/AmpliconArchitect) or AR(https://github.com/jluebeck/AmpliconReconstructor) (circle_map.sh)
    (4') Dissect the circle detected with Circle Map(https://github.com/iprada/Circle-Map) (circle_map_without_reconstruction.sh)

2. Scripts for calculating stability score and frequency of circle regions

3. Topic modeling using cisTopics
